abstract: In psychology, most research findings—and current theories informed by past research—rely on null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), a ubiquitous approach to statistical inference. However, despite its popularity, NHST is a limited and problematic approach, which puts into question the validity of a vast number of past research findings. The goal of the present thesis was to investigate two research practices—p-hacking and statistical misreporting—to determine if they were major issues within seven notable psychology journals. After running all research articles from 1945 to 2020 (spanning every five years) through *Statcheck* and plotting p-value distributions, p-hacking was observed to be a prevalent issue within particular years of published research and in specific research journals. It was also found that 14.7% of detected p-values were inconsistent with properly re-computed p-values, and that 3% of p-values were inconsistent such that it would alter the decision to reject (or retain) the null hypothesis. These findings suggest that the issue of p-hacking and statistical misreporting is cause for concern, and it warrants re-considering the reliability of past research findings.
